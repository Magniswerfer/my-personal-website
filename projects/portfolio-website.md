## Overview

This portfolio website serves as both a showcase of my work and a platform for sharing my thoughts through the integrated blog system. Built with modern technologies and performance in mind, it demonstrates clean code practices and attention to design details.

## Key Features

### Blog System
- Markdown-based content management
- YAML front matter for metadata
- Automatic post listing and pagination
- Clean typography with proper spacing

### Project Showcase
- Featured projects section
- Detailed project pages

### Technical Implementation

The website is built using the following tech stack:

```typescript
// Example of the blog post loader
export async function loadPost(slug: string): Promise<BlogPost | null> {
    try {
        const filePath = `./posts/${slug}.md`    
        const content = await Deno.readTextFile(filePath);
        // Process markdown and front matter...
        return post;   
    } catch (e) {
        console.error(`Error loading post ${slug}`, e);
        return null;
    }
}
```
